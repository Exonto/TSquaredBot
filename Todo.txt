Ensure that all creeps and structures are ours and not an opponents.

Active states may be completed even before they have been executed

Make sure that whenever a building is destroyed, creeps are able to
compensate by switching their target. This may be a problem when memory
returns a unique id to a building such as a spawn.

When a creep's memory fails to be retrieved, delete that creep's memory
so that it can start over, otherwise it will be stuck forever.

Energy sources and such may not be accessibly due to pathing.
Ensure that it can be travelled to to avoid errors.
Do not build anything on a cached path.

Use an object id retriever for lazy getting of objects by id.
