Ensure that all creeps and structures are ours and not an opponents.

Active states may be completed even before they have been executed

Make sure that whenever a building is destroyed, creeps are able to
compensate by switching their target. This may be a problem when memory
returns a unique id to a building such as a spawn.

When a creep's memory fails to be retrieved, delete that creep's memory
so that it can start over, otherwise it will be stuck forever.
